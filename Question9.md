If this was not to work out then I would keep looking for other IT support jobs that take people with just a matric. I would make sure that I continue to work part-time and maybe get another retail-job to contribute to the household. My family would be disappointed but somehow I would be able to find something further down the line that will work for me. It is not something I am particularly happy or enthusiastic to this about but I will make the most of it and take this experience as a building block although it would cause me a sadness to not make it.
