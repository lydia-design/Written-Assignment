1. My personal history is that I originally lived in Hilbrow, from when I was born till the age of two years old. Then due to my biological parents being unable to take care of me, my brother and I were put in an orphanage.  Not too long after that I met the woman that would eventually adopt me and my brother into her home. Her name was Linda and she was amazing!  She first took me to my first preschool where I was sponsored by MultiChoice to get a proper education. Following that experience I went to two primary schools and one high school where I did my best in my academics. I matriculated with a bachelors pass, after that I decided to do a Teaching English to Foreign Languages course and I was planing for the next year to move to Thailand, it was extremely exciting because it was going to be a new journey. I made all my arrangements and was booked to fly March 26 2020. Unfortunately, that is when lockdown went into full swing.  And thus, I stayed in South Africa and decided to work part time jobs until I figured something out to challenge me and make me feel excited once again.  In the meantime, I have learnt about myself and the many things I am capable of . I am really good with handling challenges and I am good with animals. My mom loves working with Great Dane Rescue which showed me I have a calming affect on abused dogs, most of the dogs we've adopted and fostered have approached me first.  I am also very creative in projects, more so make-up. I have done make-up for shoots and participated in a photo shoot. I find that working with my hands is something I enjoy and I take pride in every project I have been a part of.  In life I've always came across opportunities and tried put in my best efforts and so far has and is still working for me.  Hard work always pays off no matter how much adversity is against me, I have overcome them.  I have grown tremendously as a person throughout my life. I can't wait to keep growing and learning new things about myself and the world around me.
