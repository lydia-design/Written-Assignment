This career is something I never thought I would be able to do originally as I have never been computer savvy . After learning a bit more about computers over the past three years I became interested in Web Development. When I searched on the career path it interested me to know that different applications that I use in my daily life include it. I soon tried to find free courses and paid courses to try and learn from but they never explained the foundational material and i would find myself getting more confused and to be honest disheartened.  I either could not find the free programme I needed because financially I just could not afford to go to get into a proper one or my computer was too outdated to follow through with the work I wanted to do on it. This led me to saving up a bit of money each month to get into an excellent programme. I applied for this specific course because I got sent the pamphlet via WhatsApp and decided to just go for the opportunity. I have through this wee been able to understand so many things but feel inspired to learn more. This is an extraordinary course to be accepted in and I hope I can apply myself and proceed futher.
