I have what it  takes to do this course because I have an interest in the career and have had the for over a year now. I need this opportunity t change my life and my families lives. I want to  be the change, and remove the stigma of figuring things out after school being a way to be lazy. In every aspect I have always had to prove I am worth people taking a chance at me. I am resilient and have great work ethic. I try my best and apply myself in everything that I do. Although I may not understand fully at first, I make it my mission to practice until I am excellent at something.  An example of that is when I went for my practice learners license test I got almost everything incorrect, and my test was the next day my instructor told me I would most definitely fail. I took it upon myself to not only study but do over nine hundred questions in preparation for the test and I passed it on my first try in contrary to what my instructor thought. This course is not the same as that but trust and believe I will apply myself and work overtime if that means I can have a chance to do coding as a career. No matter the challenge I will not be discouraged by failures but motivated to surprise Umuzi at every opportunity that I am given.
