My plan to ensure all my work is done is to wake up at half past five in the morning so I can be ready for the day to begin at 6 I go into the office after breakfast and work through the day taking breaks after every two hours or so. If there is loadshedding I will wake up earlier or go through the work till about eleven at night. I do three workouts per week which are only thirty minutes long and I tend to do those first thing in the morning so that I am ready to dedicate myself to working majority of the day.
