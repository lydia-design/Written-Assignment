To be honest I do not have any relevant experience with coding, other than me trying to work through the odin project notes that gave no description or explanation for anything. I just had to install a bunch of applications and somehow write code without knowing entirely what I was doing. Although this was not the best plan, it was a learning experience and regardless of this set back still made me eager to understand and work through where I stumbled prior. I have full confidence that this time I am much more prepared with informative articles and  ways to practice and understand all the technical tools work specifically GitHub that before was difficult for me to work with and through. Now I understand the features and the building blocks to all the information that I have been provided. I appreciate the fact that there are always links to the articles in the Tilde cards so I am not completely lost on whats correct and what is not. This course allows me to be detail-orientated and exercise my understanding even more. It gives me enough information to feel comfortable attempting and doing the projects and assessments provided. The WhatsApp group is a means of communication with my peers to assist me and for me assist the when they are stuck which ensure that everyone is aware of issues they may have going forward. The weekly Qand A's allow everyone to come with their problems in understanding as we can ask staff members about things that have been struggling with. I hope that I am given the opportunity to gain experience with Umuzi.
