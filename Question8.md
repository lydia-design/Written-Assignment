If I succeed in the course and get a high value career in coding my life would be different what my life is now. I would make sure I pay my mom back for paying for my TEFL and travel costs. I would move out and get my own townhouse making sure that I can provide for not only myself and my family. I would take a holiday every year to somewhere new in South Africa and all over the world. I would make sure no matter what that I am always refreshing my knowledge and understanding .  I would sponsor other young people to do this course and get them everything they need. I would donate to womans shelters in my area and empower those women to go to recruiting agencies by giving them workshops and teaching them skills they can use to get jobs later on. I would also sponsor them to finish their GED's.
