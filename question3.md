In my free time I like to watch true crime documentaries or listen to podcasts namely Rotten Mango hosted by Stephanie Soo. I enjoy these because they are so informative on how to watch out for people and their intentions. It also gives me break from my own reality sometimes which I know sounds slightly morbid but I take interest in knowing things especially cases I have probably memorized over a hundred cases by now.  I also exercise three times a week at home because my gym is very far from where I stay, I use Youtube workouts and overtime I have accumulated lots of equipment thus it is not too much of a stretch from the gym. I also enjoy a hike with my friends on the Kloofendal hiking range those are just amazing to hike and see the view, making memories that last a lifetime. I watch anime in my free time, it is a great escape with stories of adversity and animation that is seriously out of this world. The characters are out of this world and have unique abilities but also the more story based anime that is not about the action are great too. I love the movie 'A Silent Voice' it is so emotional but also includes one of the best character development stories I have seen so far. It is incredibly one of my favourite anime movies. Funily enough I have a past time that I enjoy as well which is deep cleaning. I love creating a clean space. It is one of my more productive pass times that just allows me to almost organise my life and clear my head.
