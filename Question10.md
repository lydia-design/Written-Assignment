My current commitments are not much financially at the moment because I live at home, I am currently not working and have turned down another internship to do this course. Time wise I just do a few chores around the house which  are feeding the dogs once a day, working out 3 times a week but that is done at home, filling up water bowls which I do in my breaks. I like to have my weekends free but I am completely prepared to work on weekend to meet the deadlines of this course. Loadshedding could play a roll as I do have WiFi at home but I don't own a portable router but I just plan my time before anything goes off and print out slides as well as use my smartphone to access the internet.
