Things that might stand in the way of me having success in this course are time management for sure. Especially now I do most of the cooking and cleaning of the household. I normally spend lots of time doing my household work which includes looking after eight dogs. No one is used to me being busy with my own projects and work. What I have thus done to solve this issue is communicate to my family that they need to take on more responsibility and not leave it all up to me to do. I have put in boundaries about not disrupting me while I am in the office as this is where I work. Everyone knows what is expected of them and I have managed to step back from having so much pressure on me to being able to live harmoniously. I also find it difficult to not go down a rabbit hole, because I want to have all the information I tend to get lost in the details. My solution to this is that I stay on topic and only move to relevant sub topics and read through the articles to get an understanding them by explaining to myself out loud and making colourful notes with big headings and highlight certain detail.
